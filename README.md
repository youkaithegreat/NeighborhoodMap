### More Info & Skills Used
* In this project I utilized the *Google Maps API* to create a full screen application.
* I also utilized a *JSONP AJAX* request to *YELP's API* to find the 10 closest coffee shops to Taipei Main Station.
* It also utilizes *Knockout.js*, so that the view is actively updated.
* The site features a live search of the 10 shops with info windows and coffee markers.
* Finally, on mobile the view is slightly different featuring the listview at the bottom.
